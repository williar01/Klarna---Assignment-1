 Klarna’s partnership with retails companies around the world allows consumers to purchase good now and pay later. The partnership with retail companies provides greater access to online shopping using mobile devices.

The purpose of Klarna is to make online shopping easy, accessible, and affordable for everyone. It allows consumer to be able to shop in stores when they might not ordinarily shop at.
Klarna’s a private company founded in April 2005 in Stockholm, Sweden. Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Niklas Adalberth and Victor Jacobsson are the founders of Klarna and who’s vision was to make online payments easier for both merchants and consumers. According to the Klarna’s historical timeline there first products were invoice and part payments. Sebastian Siemiatkowski is the company’s current CEO. The start of Klarna was born from a “Shark Tank” style pitch competition in which their pitch came in last place. The pitch “Buy now, pay later” appealed to one of the judges who encouraged the founders to continue with their idea. Klarna’s funded by investors and has raised $3.7B in equity capital since its inception in April 2005. 

# Business Activities:
Back in the nineties and early 2000s consumers who could not afford to purchase product at the time would put it on layaway and pay it off between and thirty or sixty time. Consumers were not allowed to take merchandise home until paid in full. Today we have a new form of layaway and its Klarna and other companies who have the same business model of “Buy Now, Pay Later” business platform. Klarna’s business model allow consumers to purchase products online and have it shipped immediately without making a payment at the time. All the consumers must do is select Klarna as the payment type during checkout. Klarna then gives the consumer three different payment options. First payment method is four interest free installments, second payment method is pay in full in 30 days and the third payment method is financing pay over six -36 months. Klarna pays retailers upfront in full; therefore, the retailers can increase their conversion and AOV. 
Klarna offer services to retailers and consumers. Klarna has over 90M global shoppers worldwide and 20M shoppers in the United States. Klarna offer solutions to retail companies of all sizes of revenue and sales. Klarna partner with over 250K retailers ranging from small boutiques to high end retail shops. Retailers have seen an increase in revenue, conversion, ROAS since partnering with Klarna. One major difference between Klarna and PayPay, Klarna uses your online banking information to process payments; whereas, with PayPal you have to setup an e-wallet and you must add money for a credit to be able to make purchases.

# Recommendations:
I recommend that Klarna offer vacation packages and to be able to purchase tickets to events to consumers. It would open Klarna to more shoppers. If consumers can go on vacation and have the option to pay it off via one of their payment options would increase the revenues. Sometimes people need to be able to get away from the chaos, which is life, and if people able to go away right away as opposed to waiting until their trip is paid off could be beneficial to consumers.
